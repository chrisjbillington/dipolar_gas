- Fix units bugs
- Work out how to determine in-code which phase the system is in
- Verify correct results for sample points
- Make interpolation faster by doing linear interpolation manually
- Make diagonalisation faster with Cython extension
- Make CUDA code cleaner by defining a V function, forced inline with cached global value of the trig terms
    (possibly template the CUDA code to compile with hard-coded constants g and theta)
- Write code to save result to h5 file and read initial guesses from h5 file
- Write batch job submitter script that creates output folders and submits many jobs for a range of g and theta
- Minimise k_F w.r.t energy?
- Finite temperature?
- 2 layer case.
